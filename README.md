# spark-LDA-example

A simple Spark LDA example. 
This project contains a basic Document Clustering example in which data cleaning is also done.

We are going to perform these procedures for the document clustering, these steps include:

1. Spark RegexTokenizer : For Tokenization

2. Stanford NLP Morphology : For Stemming and lemmatization

3. Spark StopWordsRemover : For removing stop words and punctuation

4. Spark TF-IDF : For computing term frequencies or tf-idf

5. Spark LDA : For Clustering of documents.
